## Project Overview

This project is a React application built with TypeScript that demonstrates the implementation of a mini-map system. The mini-map overlays on top of a game interface and displays sections of a larger game map. It scrolls dynamically as the user moves the cursor around the game map.


## Features

- Mini-Map Display: A circular mini-map overlay that shows a portion of the larger game map.
- Dynamic Scrolling: The mini-map scrolls based on the cursor's position on the main game map.
- TypeScript Support: The project is built with TypeScript for better type checking and code quality.
- ESLint & Prettier Integration: Code linting and formatting are enforced with ESLint and Prettier.
- Responsive Design: The mini-map adjusts based on the user's interactions.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- Prettier: An opinionated code formatter.
- CSS: Styling for the mini-map component.

## Setup and Installation

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20 or later)
- npm or yarn

Installation

Clone the Repository:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/chiraggohel2802/mini-map-aaplication.git
cd my-app
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Running the Project

To start the project in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
## Prettier Configuration

The .prettierrc file ensures consistent code formatting:

```javascript
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "endOfLine": "auto"
}
```
## Running ESLint and Prettier

- Lint the code:

```javascript
npm run lint
```

- Fix linting issues automatically:

```javascript
npm run lint:fix
```

- Format the code using Prettier:

```javascript
npm run format
```

## Testing
You can add tests for your components using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library. Since the focus of this documentation is the mini-map and ESLint setup, testing configurations have not been covered in detail.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance Mini-Map Functionality: Add more features like zooming in/out, panning, or custom markers on the mini-map.
- Improve Performance: Optimize the background image loading and rendering for smoother scrolling.
- Add Unit Tests: Implement unit tests for all components to ensure robust code quality.
